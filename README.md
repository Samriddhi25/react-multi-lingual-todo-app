# React Todo App
This is you basic To-do App.
The feature I wanted to share with this is to use multi-language translations in your project.
I often found it hard to implement multi-language select so finally when I was able to come across a solution for it, I thought of showing it with the help of the beginner friendly "To-Do App".

## Instructions

First clone this repository.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Samriddhi25/react-multi-lingual-todo-app.git
```

Install dependencies. Make sure you already have [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org/en/) & [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed in your system.

```bash
$ npm install # or yarn
```

Run it
```bash
$ npm start # or yarn start
```

## Traslator

If you want to convert multiple string of your choice have a look at my [`translation_script`](https://replit.com/@Samriddhi25/Translator#main.py)
